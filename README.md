# 8bitCPU-COE328

Consists of 8-bit registers for input storage, finite state machine, 4-to-16 decoder, 8-bit arithmetic logic unit, and seven segment display translators to output on Cyclone II FPGA Boards.

Currently implementing a similar design structure using SystemVerilog and building on Xilinx Vivado.
